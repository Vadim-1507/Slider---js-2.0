## Install project
The first thing to do after you have clone and pull the project is to install npm: webpack, webpack-cli, node-sass. <br/>
To simplify this task, the project has a file with installed dependencies. <br/>
To install all the necessary modules use the command `npm install` in the theremin.

## Warning!!
Some files in repositories have any function, and push here that you can see development stadies.
